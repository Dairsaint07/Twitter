Team Registration and Proposal<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are multiple systems that we are going to be looking at. Some of them include MySQL, FlockDB, HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System), and Mesos. These systems are a few that store twitters information. “Twitter uses MySQL heavily for primary storage of tweets and users”. FlockDB is a graph database but its built on MySQL. The main database used today that we will be looking at is called Manhattan. This was needed because they needed a database that could do a lot of queries in a short amount of time. The system is a database that is always running. This system has low latency and is very scalable. It is a predictable system, meaning that worst case performance is imperative. Overall they tried to make the system as simple as possible because it cannot have things go wrong with it since it must remain running 24/7. Manhattan has four layers to it, the interface,storage services, storage engine, and the core. This system seems very complex but it is actually as simple as they can get it with the goals that it has to achieve (scalability, latency, uptime, etc...). <br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to collect our data for this project is to use a twitter api.  We would search some of the clients available online to see if any are similar to what we are looking for that we could use.  We would make any changes to the client if needed or create an entirely new client if we could not find one that fits what we are trying to search for.  The twitter api is able to collect just about any kind of information from twitter if you are able to create the client to get it, so any information we would need would be available to us. The database is huge so we might have to limit it by location or other factors. Also, the sample size we would include all of the user so we would have enough data.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would collect data about current political candidates.  We would search the database for their name and try to display how popular they are on twitter and see if that correlates to their position in the polls. This would show a correlation to social media popularity and whether it helps the candidate’s political popularity.  We would analyze multiple different candidates and just search whether their name appears in tweets.  We would also like to search candidate popularity based on location if possible to see which states or certain areas candidates have the most social media fame.  It will be interesting to see if social media shows candidate popularity that correlates with polls.<br>
